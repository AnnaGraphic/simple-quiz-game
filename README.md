## TODOs:
- Create a class named Question to represent a quiz question. The class should have the following features:
  x A constructor that accepts the question text and an array of options.
  x A method to display the question and its options.
  - A method to check if the user's choice is correct.
x Create instances of the Question class for at least three different quiz questions. Be creative with your questions and options.
